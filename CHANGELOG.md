# 1.0.11
Fixes:
- Natural Language Date form - was not formatting date properly if it was a 1 digit date (ex: oct 3, but working if oct 13). Reported in: https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-jump-to-date/issues/9 (Thank you @boksir)
- Changed wording in Settings to better indicate that the jump-to-date calendar is being enabled/disabled for ribbon suipport.
- Fixed an issue that the popup calendar still showed as an option in the command paleete if disabled in settings.
